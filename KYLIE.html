    <h1 id="head">Kylie Cosmetics</h1>
    <p id="p1">Kylie Jenner started the American cosmetics company Kylie Cosmetics. On November 30, 2015, the business started selling Kylie Lip Kits, a set of liquid lipstick and lip liner. The business was rebranded Kylie Cosmetics from Kylie Lip Kits.Since its debut, it's had an extremely successful run. The businesswoman has generated hundreds of millions of dollars with her makeup company through numerous collaborations.</p>
    <h3 id="subhead">Brief History</h3>
    <p id="p1">Jenner leveraged the negative coverage generated by her denial of using lip fillers in May 2015 to launch her business six months later. Love her or hate her, this strategy was successful. During Kylie Cosmetics' initial launch, the $29 Lip Kits sold out completely in under a minute.</p>
    <p id="p1">As Jenner grows older she founded Kylie Cosmetics at the age of 18. Her brand is also older. Always catching up with current beauty demands, she launched Kylie Skin when skin care-based approaches became popular and took advantage of the blush epidemic.</p>
    <h3 id="subhead">Marketing Strategy</h3>
    <p id="p1">According to Forbes, Jenner founded Kylie Cosmetics in 2015 and recorded sales of $ 400 million in the first 18 months. In November 2019, Jenner signed an agreement to sell a majority stake in a cosmetics company to beauty conglomerate Coty Inc. for $ 600 million, bringing the company's value to $ 1.2 billion.</p>
    <p id="p1">The ultimate influencer. Unlike most beauty and cosmetics companies with a presence on social media, Kylie does not need to turn to others for help when promoting her products. She is the ultimate influencer, using her own face to exhibit her makeup range.</p>
